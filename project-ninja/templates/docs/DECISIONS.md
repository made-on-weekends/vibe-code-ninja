# DECISIONS.md

> Settled architectural decisions. **Append-only.** Never edit or delete past entries (one exception: `Status` field of a superseded entry).
> If a decision is reversed, append a new entry with `Supersedes: #NNNN`.

## How to use this file

- Read before contradicting any documented pattern.
- New decisions are added with the next sequential number.
- Each entry has: number, title, date, status, context, decision, consequences, optional `Supersedes`.

## Status values

- `Proposed` — under discussion
- `Accepted` — current
- `Superseded by #NNNN` — replaced by a later decision (only the Status field can be edited on a superseded entry)
- `Deprecated` — no longer applies but no replacement

## 0001 — Project initialized

**Date:** TODO(<owner>): YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Project scaffolded with the project-ninja skill.
**Decision:** Establish AGENTS.md and docs/ as the source of truth for AI agent context. Cross-references owned per `references/cross-references.md` in the project-ninja skill.
**Consequences:** All AI tools (Claude Code, Antigravity, Codex, Cursor) read AGENTS.md. Decisions affecting the codebase land here.

<!-- TODO(<owner>): Add additional decisions as they are made. Template:

## NNNN — Title

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** What prompted the decision.
**Decision:** What was decided.
**Consequences:** What this changes about how we build.
**Supersedes:** #NNNN (only if applicable)
